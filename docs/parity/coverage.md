# Parity coverage

This file used to hold a generated coverage snapshot from an older `tools/coverage.py`. That tool no
longer exists and the numbers here were badly out of date — they claimed 275 of 1103 functions
recreated while the real figure was already over 600, and they listed functions as unported that had
been ported and tested. Rather than keep a second, contradictory report, the snapshot is retired.

The live report is `PARITY.md`, regenerated with:

```
python docs/parity/coverage.py     # totals
python docs/parity/gen_report.py   # writes PARITY.md
```

The audits that keep the report honest are `docs/parity/audit_credits.py` (a port claim next to a
port denial), `docs/parity/audit_names.py` (a credited address whose original name has no definition
in the port), `docs/parity/audit_bugs.py` (code markers against `docs/parity/bugs.tsv`), and
`docs/parity/audit_tables.py` (hand-copied tables diffed against the shipped image).
